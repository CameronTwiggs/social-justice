    <p class="description2">Here at Garden Of Eden,<br> we believe in helping our communities.
        Our mission has always been to help those in need. <br>
        Many do not have access to basic necessities that are needed therefore, <br>
        our team has come up with this site to help combat hunger and help those who really need it!
